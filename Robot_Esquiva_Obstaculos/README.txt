Description
The repository is a project on a mobile robot 
that contains a claw at the top and serves as a 
prototype of a rescue robot that is controlled by 
the kinect sensor and the two hands with which 
the displacement of the base in four axes 
is controlled and the claw.


INOS FILES
The arduino classes file contains
 the arduino code to perform the engine 
and claw movements that are located on the mobile base


c# Files
In the codes of c # you get the programming 
for the screen that will be displayed on the computer
 in addition to having the code of the joints that
the kinect detects in order to be able to read 
the human body and finally the serial communication 
for the arduino.
